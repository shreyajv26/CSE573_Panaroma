# CSE573_Panaroma
CSE 573 - Computer Vision and Image Processing




The goal of this task is to experiment with image stitching methods. Given a set of photos, your
program should be able to stitch them into a panoramic photo (as shown in Figure 1). There are
no restrictions regarding the method you use to stitch photos into a panoramic photo.
For this project, you can assume the following:
 Your code will need to be able to stitch together anywhere from 2-5 image and you will not
know that in advance.

 You can assume that IF an image is to be part of the panorama, it will overlap at least one
other image and by at least 20%.

 Images that do not overlap with any other image can be ignored.

 Images will overlap with at most one other image.

 You are only expected to produce one panorama. For example, if images 1 and 2 overlap, and
3 and 4 overlap, but there is not overlap between 1,2 and 3,4 producing either composite/-
panorama is fine.
